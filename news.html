            has successfully defended 
            his PhD thesis titled <i>`Exploring Neutrino Oscillations with T2K: Integrating Updated Interaction Models and
            New Topological Event Sample for a Precision 3-Flavour Framework Analysis at 
            3.1x10<sup>22</sup> Protons on Target.'</i>.
	    Jaiden was co-supervised by Prof. Davide Sgalaberna at ETHZ.
            We would like to thank Dr. Andy Blake and Dr. Joe Price
            for agreeing to serve in Jaiden's examination panel.
            Congratulations <span class="NewsName">Dr. Parlone</span>!
	    <br />
	    Jaiden's viva marks the end of an era! Jaiden is our last ever student working in the VALOR analysis in T2K.
	    Since 2010, by analyzing T2K data within VALOR,
	    our group has contributed to many oscillation results and 12 published T2K papers.		  
            The time has come for us to move on to new things.

	    Our group has now been granted Observer Status in the 
            <A href="http://juno.ihep.cas.cn/" target="_top">JUNO</A> experiment in southern China.
            This is a multi-purpose experiment, whose primary aim is the determination of the neutrino mass ordering 
            from the measurements of reactor anti-neutrinos from the Yangjiang and Taishan nuclear power plants.
            Liverpool is only the second U.K. institute to join this exciting project, after the University of Warwick.
            Liverpool and Warwick are bringing world-leading expertise in simulation and analysis of 
            GeV-scale neutrino interactions, and will be focussing in the analysis of atmospheric neutrino data in JUNO.
            Our aim is to help JUNO achieve the first definitive neutrino mass-ordering determination,
	    by exploiting the complementary neutrino mixing information in the atmospheric neutrino data.

            The Liverpool Particle Physics group has secured £1.1M in the recent STFC PPGP 2022 PDRA call,
            to support several key post-doctoral positions across our programme. The grant will support 
            a new post-doctoral position in our group, for the full period till the start of the next Consolidated Grant, 
            to enable us to contribute more effectively in the early SBND and SBN physics exploitation program.

            It is exceptionally hard to describe Francis's contributions within a few lines of a news item.
            He led the <A href="https://valor.pp.rl.ac.uk" target="_top">VALOR T2K 3-flavour fit</A>

            on September 22nd.
            Rhiannon was a highly successful and hard-working PhD student, 
            one of the first on SBND, who made ground-breaking contributions in 
            establishing the SBND simulation and reconstruction chains,
            developing exclusive SBND selections based on automated event reconstruction,
            leading the development (within the <A href="https://valor.pp.rl.ac.uk" target="_top">VALOR framework</A>)
            of the SBN oscillation analysis, and performing analyses of first mock data to
            explore limitations of the current SBN oscillation analysis paradigm.
            In addition to her numerous analysis tasks,
            over a year-long stay at Fermilab, Rhiannon supported the early SBND construction/installation work.

            <u><b>2020/12/01: Successful completion of our European Space Agency funded POSITRINO project </b></u>
            <br />
            <br />
            On December 1st, <span class="NewsName">Costas Andreopoulos</span>, <span class="NewsName">Chris Barry</span>, 
            <span class="NewsName">Marco Roda</span> and <span class="NewsName">Júlia Tena Vidal</span> 
            participated in the <b>final review of the POSITRINO project</b>. This is a European Space Agency (ESA) funded project for a 
            preliminary exploration of the <b>innovative and disrupting technological concept of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) 
            applications based on neutrinos</b>. 
            In this project, Liverpool teamed up with 
            Ana Cez&oacute;n Moro, Javier Fidalgo Prieto, Stefano Melis and others from 
            <A href="https://www.gmv.com" target="_top">GMV Innovations</A>, a technological 
            business group headquartered in Madrid, with leading presence in many sectors including Defence and Security, Space, and Aeronautics. 
            The project was aimed at applications where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) cannot work, such as 
            i) submarine navigation, ii) navigation in the Earth poles, where no GNSS satellites are in view, or iii) sub-surface applications. 
            Submarine navigation was chosen as the benchmark application due to the obvious disrupting potential: 
            Using neutrinos for navigation, in conjunction with other sensors, would allow military nuclear submarines to remain submerged, 
            in stealth mode, for very long times. 
            The final review was attended by several key figures in the field of including the Head of ESA GNNS Strategy,
            as well as German, Italian and Czech state delegates to ESA. 
            According to Florin Grec overseeing this work on behalf of ESA along with Luis Mendes,
            <i>“The final outcome of the project surpassed our expectations and we are very pleased by the work done by GMV and Liverpool”.</i> 
            Details will appears in a future publication.

            <span class="NewsName">Costas Andreopoulos</span> 
            discussed the significance of improving our understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions 
            and highlight some of the most pertinent puzzles in neutrino interaction physics,
            and emphasised open problems in neutrino interaction phenomenology.
            We would like to thank Joachim Kopp for the opportunity to discuss these

               target="_top">discussed proposals</A>, on behalf
            of the GENIE collaboration, that would enable experiments to reuse their well-established
            workflows and GENIE interfaces and toolkits (event generation, flux and detector 
            geometry drivers) in order to run a host of alternative physics simulations
            that are development by smaller groups and lack the extensive toolkit present in GENIE.
            The proposal, exemplifies the key role of the GENIE group in supporting the development
            of physics simulations for the experimental neutrino community:            
            It would produce <b>significant effiencies in delivering alternative physics simulations into
            the full simulation chain of modern experiments</b>, removing the need for duplication of
            very extensive toolkits, and allowing developers to focus on the most crucial aspects of physics modelling.

            under a KM3NeT Pilot Exchange Program supported by the KM3NeT-INFRADEV H2020 action.
            The members of the Liverpool group worked primarily with the group of <span class="NewsName">J.D. Zornoza</span>
            on GENIE simulations and interaction systematics in support of the broader KM3NeT physics program.
            We would like to thank Juan de Dios for the hospitality, as well as for the
            opportunity to spend two weeks focussed on GENIE research together with several
            long-time colleagues at IFIC, and enjoy Valencia!
            The Liverpool group will be back for a second 2-week visit in fall!

            on the T2K hints for CP invariance violation by neutrinos! 
            Our group played a key role in this 3-flavour oscillation result through the development of the
            <A href="https://valor.pp.rl.ac.uk" target="_top">VALOR</A> analysis, 
            and our PhD student <span class="NewsName">Chris Barry</span> was a lead analyzer.
            This beautiful and world-leading result will be presented in detail in Chris' PhD dissertation!

            Time Projection Chamber (HPGArTPC) option for the DUNE Near Detector (ND), and provided the first end-to-end 3-flavour 
            oscillation analysis for DUNE for the evaluation of all ND design options.
